â€¢ lol. turns out the canvas always appears to blank to the main thread when it's
off screen. have to come up with a new plan for getting waveforms into buttons.

removing this piece of code:

	// find the top and bottom
	for (let f32 of visibleSound) {
	  max = f32 > max ? f32 : max
	  min = f32 < min ? f32 : min
	}

i think it might matter if the sound being input was ever 32-bit floating point(?)
but right now it never will be and using -1 to 1 will mean i get to remove 1
extra loop. the code in the canvas has to run 60 times a second so it's
important to do as little as possible.

the sound worker's code runs like 500 times a second!

also this code:
	let colorSpace = matchMedia("(color-gamut: p3)").matches
		? "display-p3"
		: "srgb"
